### Purpose
The project is a Visual Basic 6 (VB6) application designed to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database. It provides a graphical user interface for managing client records, allowing users to search, add, edit, and delete client information stored in a Microsoft Access database.

### Key Modules

1. **ClientesFrm.frm**

   - **Key Features**: 
     - Display client data in a grid.
     - Buttons for adding, editing, and deleting records.
     - Navigation controls for browsing through records.

2. **CRUDMod.bas**
   - **Purpose**: Contains the core logic for performing CRUD operations on the database.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Functions for connecting to the database.
     - SQL query execution for insert, update, delete, and select operations.

3. **BuscarFrm.frm**
   - **Purpose**: A form dedicated to searching for client records.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Input fields for search criteria.
     - Display of search results.

4. **TextBoxesMod.bas**
   - **Purpose**: Provides utility functions for handling text box controls within the forms.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Validation of input data.
     - Formatting of text box content.

5. **GeneralMod.bas**
   - **Purpose**: Contains general-purpose utility functions used across the application.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Commonly used procedures and functions.

6. **HelpersMod.bas**
   - **Purpose**: Provides helper functions to support various operations in the application.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Miscellaneous utility functions.

### Dependencies

- **VB6 Runtime**: The application is built using Visual Basic 6, requiring the VB6 runtime environment to execute.
- **Microsoft Access Database**: The application interacts with a `.mdb` file, which is a Microsoft Access database, to store and retrieve client data.
- **ADO (ActiveX Data Objects)**: Used for database connectivity and operations.
